This tutorial will be a guide through the first few steps of primary data analysis:
1. [FASTQ generation with `cellranger mkfastq`](#section1)
2. [Making a custom genome reference with `cellranger mkref`](#section2)
3. [Mapping and count matrix generation with `cellranger count`](#section3)
4. [Combining two samples into a shared, normalized matrix with `cellranger aggr`](#section4)

## Single Cell Lab, Experiment A: Single-Cell RNAseq with Cell Hashing
[Cell Hashing Description](https://cite-seq.com/cell-hashing/)

[Wet Lab Protocol](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mitbrqaxtgbavgo/SeqTech_2022_SingCell_protocol.docx?dl=0)  
For the scRNA-seq portion, we ran a simple experiment that will explore changes in gene expression as a function of cell culture density. Two different human cervical cancer lines, HeLa and Siha, were plated in 6-well format on Friday spanning a wide range of densities.  On Tuesday morning before the lab, we inspected these cultures and identified wells that roughly corresponded to a desirable range of confluencies (33%, 66%, 100%).  During lecture, we trypsinized these wells to produce a single-cell suspension.


| Cell Line | Cells seeded    | Confluency% | Hash Tag |
| --------- | :-------------: | :--------:  | :------: |
|HeLa       | 25k             | 33          | 1        |
|HeLa       | 50k             | 66          | 2        |
|HeLa       | 150k            | 100         | 3        |
|Siha       | 25k             | 33          | 4        |
|Siha       | 75k             | 66          | 5        |
|Siha       | 200k            | 100         | 6        |


Libraries were prepared according to the 10X Genomics User Guide and loaded onto a NextSeq2000 P3 flow cell with the following read lengths:  

| Read1 | Index1 | Index2 | Read2 |
|---|---|---|---|
|28bp|10bp|10bp|90bp|

Hash tags (a.k.a. Antibody-derived tags, or ADTs) were amplified in parallel, quantified, and spiked in at 5% molarity compared with the GEX library.

**Congratulations!  You didn't screw up an experiment.  Now you might have data.**

To demulitiplex, we are going to use 10X's built-in pipeline, designed for their cholesterol-modified oligo hash tagging system called <a href=https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cellplex>Cellplex</a>

Cell Ranger `count` doesn't support this natively, so we need to use a newer Cell Ranger function called 'multi'
